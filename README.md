_NCBS Curation Comments:_ This model shows the control mechanism of Jak-Stat
pathway, here SOCS1 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling-I) was identified as the
negative regulator of Jak and STAT signal transduction pathway. This is the
knockout version of Jak-Stat pathway in this model the SOCS1 has been knocked
out i.e it formation is not shown. The graphs are almost similar to the graphs
as shown in the paper but STAT1n graph has some ambiguities. Thanks to Dr
Satoshi Yamada for clarifying some of those ambiguities and providing the
values used in simulations.

_Biomodels Curation Comments:_ The model reproduces the figures 2
(B,D,F,H,J,L,N) corresponding to JAK/STAT activation in SOCS1 knock out cells.
The model was successfully tested on MathSBML
